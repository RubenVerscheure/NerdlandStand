# Nerdland stand

##### UGent Campus Kortrijk has been given the opportunity to create an inspiring installation for the 4-day Nerdland Festival. The goal of this project is to showcase the unique characteristics of the campus Kortrijk programs in an engaging and interactive way.
##### The installation is designed with the festival audience in mind: a diverse mix of nerds, makers, and families with children. It aims to provide visitors with a fun, memorable experience in a short timeframe, and potentially even a tangible keepsake from their visit.

## File overview
This Github provides access to all STL files and code to build, repair and upgrade the vinyl disc thermoformer

### STL Files
The STL files include the designs for the 3D-printed components of the installation. Below is a list of the files and their respective purposes:

●	**Cable_holder:** Keeps cables organized and in place. <br/>
●	**IR_sensor_holder:** Enclosure for the IR sensor. <br/>
●	**Lever_mechanism:** Mechanical components for connecting and reinforcing the levers of the thermoformer. <br/>
●	**Linear_movement:** Support and connection for the y-movement of the hot-box. <br/>
●	**Misc:** Various mounting and support components. <br/>
●	**Push_push_mechanism:** Push-push mechanism to hold the records at their highest place with a quick release. <br/>
●	**Vacuum_box:** Vacuum chamber for thermoforming. <br/>
●	**Z-movement:** Components for holding lineair bearings, connecting to the levers and holding guiding rods. <br/>
●	**Sticker applicator:** A small tool for easily applying your custom labels to the vinyl records. <br/>

### Arduino Code
The Arduino code controls the electronics and functionality of the installation:

**●	MLX_motor_Final:** <br/>
  &emsp; ○	Controls the temperature sensor, which determines when the motor moves the heating element aside. <br/>
  &emsp; ○	Operates the LEDs and display that indicate when thermoforming is possible. <br/>
**●	Warmte_circuit_Final:** <br/>
  &emsp; ○	Controls the heating element (on/off). <br/>
  &emsp; ○	Adds a safety mechanism using a limit switch. <br/>

### Affinity files
Both the PDF and affinity files of the stickers and poster have been made available to adapt as promotional material
